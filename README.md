# Plates
Matlab Plate Recognition

This project aims to read any car plate with Matlab from any image. Some functions come from Peter
Kovesi's libray (https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/#spatial) but they are also provided here.

The next step will shape the rectification (basically a homography) of the ROI from 4 Harris corners
and some parallel lines detected by a Hough transfom.
