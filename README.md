# Plates
**Matlab Plate Recognition**

This project aims to read any car plate in **Matlab**. Some functions come from **Peter Kovesi**'s [libray](https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/#spatial). So don't forget to add the *PeterKovesi* directory into your Matlab path.

The next step will consist to rectify the region of interest (with a homography basically) from the 4 Harris corners and the main lines detected by a Hough transform.
