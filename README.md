# Plates
Matlab Plate Recognition

This project aims to read any car plate with Matlab. Some functions come
from Peter Kovesi's libray (https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/#spatial)
but they are also provided here (just to forget to add them in your Matlab
path).

The next step will shape the rectification (basically a homography) of the
ROI from 4 Harris corners and some parallel lines detected by a Hough
transfom.
